# Large File Transfer Enhancements

This document explains the enhancements made to the AWS Backup UI to better handle large file transfers (30-40GB) and Glacier retrieval operations.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Upload Capabilities

- **Chunked Uploads**: Files larger than 1GB are now automatically split into optimal chunks (up to 200MB per chunk) for reliable transfer
- **Resumable Uploads**: If an upload is interrupted, it can be resumed from where it left off
- **Better Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with estimated time remaining and transfer speed
- **Pause/Resume**: Large uploads can be paused and resumed later

### 2. Enhanced Download Capabilities

- **Chunked Downloads**: Large files are downloaded in chunks to avoid browser memory issues
- **Resumable Downloads**: If a download is interrupted, it can be resumed from where it left off
- **Better Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with estimated time remaining and transfer speed

### 3. Improved Glacier Integration

- **Better Status Tracking**: Enhanced monitoring of Glacier restoration status
- **Detailed Information**: More detailed information about restoration options and costs
- **Restoration Progress**: Visual progress indicators for ongoing restorations

### 4. User Experience Improvements

- **Large File Warnings**: Notifications for users when handling very large files
- **Improved Progress UI**: More detailed transfer progress information
- **Status Indicators**: Clear status indicators for all operations
- **Automatic Retries**: Failed chunks are automatically retried without user intervention

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses several AWS SDK v3 features:

1. **Multipart Upload API**: For better chunked uploads
2. **Range Requests**: For efficient chunked downloads
3. **Transfer Acceleration**: For faster transfers when available
4. **Local Storage**: For tracking transfer state and enabling resumability

## Supported File Sizes

- **Standard Files**: Up to 5GB
- **Large Files**: 5GB to 50GB with enhanced handling
- **Very Large Files**: Files larger than 50GB will use specialized chunking strategies

## Limitations

- Browser upload/download capabilities may still be limited by the client's hardware and network
- Very large files (>50GB) may require extended time to process
- Glacier restorations still depend on AWS processing times for the selected tier

## User Tips

1. Use a stable internet connection for large transfers
2. Keep the browser tab open during transfers
3. For very large files, prefer a wired connection over Wi-Fi
4. Select the appropriate Glacier restoration tier based on urgency vs. cost
